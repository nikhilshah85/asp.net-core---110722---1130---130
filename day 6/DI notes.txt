					Dependency Injection

(this is global concept and pattern used by framework) 

	1. A website has more than 1000 users in a day
	2. Developers creates lots of objects in a web app
		but they never(95% of developers) do not destroy the object, 
							 clear the references,
							close 	connections, files etc...

			They all depend on framework, 
			we know GC wil come and clear it
				but when does gc comes >
		The objects will keep on filling up the ram, cache etc, and after sometime ur application performance goes down
		Admins will re-start  the app during low traffic time

	3.Henceforth, pattern says let object cretion be a part of Framework
		1. Framework will create/active your object, and inject it whereever required
		2. It will also help with Shareing the object with other classes, based on your needs
		3. It will destroy the object, as per your intentions / requrirements

			Just dont create the object
			for shareing the object, Framework Services will take care of you
		
		This is a 2 step process
		1. where ever u need the object, inject the reference from a framewokk obj, this can be done in 3 ways
			a. constructor Injection
			b. Method injection
			c. Property injection

		2. In the services, configure, what is the lifetime of an object

			a. PerCall (Transient) - Object will be created, method will be processed and object is destroyed 
			b. PerSession (persession) - 1 object for every user, object is drestoyed when session end
			c. SingleTon (singleTon) - 1 shared object for at application level - Global Object
